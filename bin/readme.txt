Gnat's Tetris Machine

SUMMARY

	Gnat's Tetris Machine is a remake of Alexey Pajitnov's classic "Tetris" from 1985.

	Gnat's Tetris Machine is written in pure C, and makes use of the OpenGL API for 3D graphics, and SDL for things like input and sound. It features a clean, commented, well structured C source code that can be used as a resource for learning how to program video games in C.

	Gnat's Tetris Machine was originally written by Nathaniel Sabanski.
