# Tetris Machine
### A 3D remake of Alexey Pajitnov's classic "Tetris" from 1985.

Tetris Machine is written in pure ANSI C using OpenGL API for 3D graphics, and SDL for input and sound. It features a clean, commented source code that can be used as a resource for learning how to program video games in C. Makefiles for Linux and Windows included.

All code and graphics created by Nathaniel Sabanski (http://natpixels.com)

## Gameplay Tips

Points multiply for clearing more than 1 row at a time. Large bonus for clearing 4 rows at a time (Pajitnov calls this a "Tetris"). See how many "Wanted Stars" you can get. If you manage to survive long enough, you may get to see the special Pepperidge Farms ending.*
