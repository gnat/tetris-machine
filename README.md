**Tetris Machine is a remake of Alexey Pajitnov's classic "Tetris" from 1985.**

Tetris Machine is written in pure ANSI C, OpenGL API for 3D graphics, and SDL for input and sound. It features a clean, commented, C source code that can be used as a resource for learning how to program video games in C. Makefiles for Linux and Windows included.

Tetris Machine was originally written by Nathaniel Sabanski.

**Gameplay Tips**

Points multiply for clearing more than 1 row at a time. Large bonus for clearing 4 rows at a time (Pajitnov calls this a "Tetris"). See how many "Wanted Stars" you can get. If you manage to survive long enough, you may get to see the special Pepperidge Farms ending.*

* There really is no "Pepperidge Farms" ending.
